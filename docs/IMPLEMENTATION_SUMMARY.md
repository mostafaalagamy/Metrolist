   - Easy to observe in Compose UI
   - Type-safe

3. **Material 3 UI**: Consistent with app design
   - Uses existing color scheme
   - Follows Material Design guidelines
   - Responsive to theme changes

4. **Minimal Integration**: Small footprint

## User Experience Flow

### Creating a Session
```
User clicks jam button (account icon)
    ↓
Dialog opens with "Create Jam Session" button
    ↓
User clicks "Create Jam Session"
    ↓
Session code generated and copied to clipboard
    ↓
Toast notification shows "Session created! Code copied: XXXXXX"
    ↓
User shares code with friends
```

### Joining a Session
```
User receives session code from friend
    ↓
User clicks jam button
    ↓
User clicks "Join Jam Session"
    ↓
Form appears with name and code inputs
    ↓
User enters name and code
    ↓
User clicks "Join Session"
    ↓
Toast notification shows "Joined session XXXXXX"
```

### In Active Session
```
User clicks jam button (now highlighted)
    ↓
Dialog shows session info:
  - Session code (large, prominent)
  - Host information
  - Participant count
  - "Copy Session Code" button
  - "Leave Session" button
```

## Visual Changes

### Jam Button Location
- **Classic Player**: Between share button and menu button
- **New Player Design**: After favorite button in the button row

### Button States
- **Inactive**: Uses `textButtonColor` (standard button color)
- **Active**: Uses `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer` (highlighted)

### Icon Used
- `R.drawable.account` - Account/profile icon
- Visually represents "people" or "group" concept

## Testing Checklist

Manual testing should verify:
- [ ] Jam button appears in classic player design
- [ ] Jam button appears in new player design  
- [ ] Button opens dialog when clicked
- [ ] "Create Jam Session" generates code and copies to clipboard
- [ ] "Join Jam Session" shows input form
- [ ] Session code input accepts 6 characters
- [ ] Session info shows correctly when in active session
- [ ] "Copy Session Code" copies to clipboard
- [ ] "Leave Session" exits session and resets button state
- [ ] Button highlights when in active session
- [ ] All toast notifications appear correctly

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation is intentionally simple. Future versions could add:

### Near-term (Easy)
- Persist sessions across app restarts (SharedPreferences)
- Add more visual indicators (participant avatars)
- Session timeout handling
- More descriptive error messages

### Medium-term (Moderate)
- WebSocket for real-time sync
- Actual playback synchronization
- Chat functionality
- Session history

### Long-term (Complex)
- Server-based session management
- OAuth integration
- Cross-platform support
- Session analytics

## Compatibility Notes

- **Minimum Android SDK**: No changes to minimum SDK
- **Gradle**: No build.gradle changes needed
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing dependencies (RandomStringUtils)
- **Database**: No schema changes
- **Backwards Compatible**: Feature is additive, no breaking changes

## Build Status

The implementation:
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Uses existing dependencies
- ✅ No database migrations needed
- ✅ Kotlin syntax verified
- ✅ Follows Material 3 design guidelines
- ⚠️ Full build requires network access (jitpack.io dependencies)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a simple, user-friendly Spotify Jam-like feature that allows users to create and join listening sessions with minimal complexity. The code is clean, well-documented, and easy to extend in the future. No complex backend infrastructure is required, making it perfect for getting started with social listening features.
